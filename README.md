Key Features
Comprehensive Collection: The repository covers a wide range of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and algorithms like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.

Educational Material: Each implementation is accompanied by clear explanations and comments, making it a valuable resource for learning and reinforcing concepts.

Efficiency and Performance: The implementations are designed with a focus on efficiency and performance, showcasing best practices for real-world applications.

Contribution Guidelines: Contributions from the community are encouraged. If you have ideas for new data structures or algorithms, or if you find ways to improve existing implementations, please consider contributing.

Getting Started
To get started with this repository, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can explore the various folders containing implementations of different data structures and algorithms. Each folder may also include example usage and test cases.

Example Usage:

#include <iostream>
#include "path/to/data_structure_or_algorithm.h"

int main() {
    // Example usage of a data structure or algorithm
    // ...

    return 0;
}


This repo is for exercises in data structures (and in some cases, recreating certain structures from scratch)

- BTree: Creation of BTree structure and basic operations. Includes helper functions such as insertNonFull and splitChild.

- arrayList: Full class with  Array list implementations and complete operations (initialization, insertion, delete,
binary search). Class accepts any type of data (templates). Test code is provided.

- doublyLinkedList: Entire DLL implementation and test code.

- genericNumOperations: Class template to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two variables num1 and num2. Test code provided.

- linkedList: Entire SLL implementation (including reversal) and test code.

- printMaxVal: Program that finds max of integral data set. Includes user input with the test code.

- priorityQueue: Priority queue generic class implementation and test code (enqueue, dequeue, merge).

- recursion: Prints first 50 natural numbers using recursion, but is generalized for other 'print first _ numbers' cases. Also includes a function for computing GCD using recursion. Test code included.

- stackCalculator: Program that calculates mathematical expressions using the STL stack data structure. Test code provided.

- swap: Generic function for swapping two variables using pointers

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new implementations, improvements, or bug fixes, follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the repository. Your contributions will help others in their journey to mastering data structures and algorithms in C++.
